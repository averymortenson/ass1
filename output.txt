tp1: []
tp2: [R 90]
tp3: [F]
tp4: [10]
tp5 is a copy of tp2: [R 90]
tp5 == tp2: true
tp3 != tp4: true
tp1 = tp3 + tp4: [F 10]
tp3 should print F: tp3 is [F]
tp1 += tp2: [F 10 R 90]
tp6: []
tp6 += tp1: [F 10 R 90]
tp1 = tp2 * 3: [R 90 R 90 R 90]
tp2 *= 3: [R 90 R 90 R 90]
tp7: []
tp7 *= 3 (should be empty): []
tp5 before calling setIndex: [R 90]
index 0 of tp5: R
setting index 0 to 'F' & index 1 to '10'.
tp5 after 2 calls to setIndex: [F 10]
Done.
